### Chatbot for Slack using Python and AIML (Python Artificial Intelligence Markup Language)

We will create a chatbot – an “intelligent” agent that you interact with via a “chat” client – that a patient would use to get an appointment with the nurse. We’re going to use some simulated data from a medical office.
The mission is to [a] create the framework for a running chatbot via Slack, AWS API gateway, and AWS Lambda and then [b] create the ability of your chatbot to answer a set of sample questions. Our system will be named The Intelligent Nurse Assistant (“TINA”). 
While we will stop short of truly robust and intelligent processing (aka “AI”), successful completion of this assignment lays the groundwork for such future enhancements.
